# Responsive To-Do List Application

## Overview
This project is a responsive to-do list application that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. Users can add new tasks, mark tasks as complete, delete tasks, and filter tasks based on their status (all, pending, completed). The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a smooth user experience across different devices.

## Features
- **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks using the input field and the "Add Task" button.
- **Complete Tasks**: Users can mark tasks as complete, which will apply a strikethrough style to the task.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can delete tasks, removing them from the list.
- **Filter Tasks**: Users can filter tasks to view all tasks, only pending tasks, or only completed tasks.

## HTML Structure
The HTML structure includes:
- A main container that holds all the elements of the to-do list.
- An input field for adding new tasks.
- A button to add tasks.
- A dropdown menu to filter tasks.
- An unordered list to display tasks.

## CSS Styling
The CSS styles the to-do list for a clean and responsive design:
- **Body**: Centers the main container and applies a background image and color.
- **Container**: Sets a fixed width, padding, border radius, and background color.
- **Inputs and Buttons**: Styles the task input, add task button, and filter dropdown for a cohesive look.
- **Task List**: Styles individual tasks, including hover effects and animations for a dynamic user experience.
- **Responsiveness**: Adjusts the layout for smaller screens to ensure usability on mobile devices.

## JavaScript Functionality
The JavaScript adds interactivity to the to-do list:
- **Add Task**: Adds a new task to the list when the user clicks the "Add Task" button.
- **Handle Task Actions**: Handles marking tasks as complete and deleting tasks.
- **Filter Tasks**: Filters tasks based on the selected option in the dropdown menu.

## How to Use
